# Effective Exploration Based on Structural Information Principles (SI2E)

This repository is dedicated to the implementations associated with our work on effective exploration using structural information principles.

## Algorithm Implementations

The structure of this repository is divided into multiple directories. Each directory houses the code for evaluations conducted with specific algorithms:

- `SI2E_A2C/`: This directory includes the implementation for evaluating the A2C algorithm with various exploration methods on MiniGrid environments.
- `SI2E_DrQv2/`: This directory includes the implementation for evaluating the DrQv2 algorithm with various exploration methods on DeepMind Control Suite tasks.
